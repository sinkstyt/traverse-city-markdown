*****

## Why bother?
* cherry festival every June
* watersports all summer
* really long summer daylight hours (so close to the 45 parallel North)
* within a 45 minute drive of Sleeping Bear Sand Dune National Reserve

*****

### Brief Description
* the city stands on the southern shores of two large swaths of Lake Michigan that cut into the Northwest corner of the Michigan "mitten"
* streets are very bike friendly
* great selection of restaurants and brewpubs
* the state as a whole recently opened its doors to recreational (or just medicinal?) THC
* nearly countless, pristine lakes nearby:
1. Long Lake
2. Torch Lake
3. Interlochen (renowned for summer concerts in an open-walled ampitheater)
4. Elk Lake
5. Silver Lake
